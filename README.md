Lab05: PCB Design (Breadboarding)

Step 1: Build a circuit using the breadboard, RPI, and the GrovePi light and sound sensors.

Step 2: Create a test program. The goal:
		1) Blink the LED 5 times with an on/off interval of 500ms

		2) Read and print the light sensor outputs for 5 seconds, in intervals of 100ms. Print either "light" or "dark" depending on how the output relates to a threshold value

		3) Blink the LED 4 times with an on/off time of 200ms

		4) Read and print the sound sensor output for 5 seconds, in intervals of 100ms. Turn on the LED if the sound sensor is tapped. 

		5) Blink the LED 4 times with on/off intervals of 200ms

		The test program I created is called sensor_test.py
